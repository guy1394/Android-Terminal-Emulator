I am not\r\naccepting pull requests any more.\r\n\r\nTerminal Emulator for Android is a terminal emulator for communicating with the\r\nbuilt-in Android shell. It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital\r\nEquipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes, so that programs like \"vi\", \"Emacs\"\r\nand \"NetHack\" will display properly.\r\n\r\nThis application was previously named \"Android Terminal Emulator\". Same great\r\napplication, just with a new name. (The change was made at the request of the\r\nAndroid trademark owner.)\r\n\r\nThis code is based on the \"Term\" application which is included in the Android\r\nOpen Source Project. (Which I also wrote. :-) )\r\n\r\n[Download the Terminal Emulator for Android from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm)\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to use the Play Store, you can also\r\n[download from GitHub](https://jackpal.github.io/Android-Terminal-Emulator/)\r\n\r\nSee [Building](docs/Building.md) for build instructions.\r\n\r\nGot questions? Please check out the\r\n[FAQ](http://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\nand/or the [Google+ Android Terminal Emulator Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106164413936367578283)\r\nbefore emailing or adding an issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\nPlease see the\r\n[Recent Updates](http://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/wiki/Recent-Updates)\r\npage for recent updates.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
